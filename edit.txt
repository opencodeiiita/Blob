Context
The backend is built using hono, you can find the hono server in apps/server
to support monitoring, we need health check API endpoint

goal
implement a simple health check endpoint that confirms the backend service is running.

Technical requirements
use hono obv
add a new http endpoint (e.g. /health)
endpoint should return a 200 ok
DON'T CREATE trpc ENDPOINT FOR THIS PURPOSE
specification
method GET
path /health
responsse body (e.g.):
{
"status": "ok"
}
Optional additions:

service name
timestamp
deliverables
health endpoint implemented in backend
clean, idiomatic Hono code
notes
this endpoint is intentionally simple
avoid adding heavy logic or checks
can be extended later (DB connectivity checks, etc)
